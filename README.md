- Errors are redirected to an errors page defined with the error.pug template. It displays the error message, status code and stack.

- On the index and project pages a different font is used for my name and the app names. They are imported from Google Fonts into layout.pug and used in the my-name and app-name classes defined at the bottom of style.css.

- On the index page hovering over a project expands it slightly. The effect uses the app-cell class defined at the bottom of style.css.
