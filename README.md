- Errors are redirected to an errors page defined with the error.pug template. It displays the error message, status code and stack.

- On the index and project pages a different font is used for my name and the app names. They are imported from Google Fonts into layout.pug and used in the my-name and app-name classes defined at the bottom of style.css.

- On the index page hovering over a project expands it slightly. The effect is applied to index.pug using the app-cell class defined at the bottom of style.css.

- The "me" sidebar, on left side, has a background image of a computer screen. The image is applied to layout.pug using the bk-img class defined at the bottom of style.css. Also, sidebar elements' font color was changed to better contrast against the image, found in elements p and a in the portfolio-me class.
